## Questions
1. What is **system call**?
2. How to run `strace` in QEMU ARM32 environment?
3. The relationship between the C library(e.g. `glibc`) and Linux kernel. How 
4. How does `glibc` invoke system calls in the Linux kernel?
5. 

## What to new
### system call
- The **system call** is the interface between an user space application and the Linux kernel.  
- System calls are not invoked directly, but rather via wrapper function in `glibc`.
  - OK... how to prove it? Where is wrapper functions in `glibc`?

For more details  
```shell
$ man 2 syscalls
```
Let's analyze the `glibc` and the Linux kernel for system calls.

In the `glibc` side.  
First, the decalaration of system calls are in `/include/unistd.h`  
For example, `__libc_write`  
```c
extern ssize_t __libc_write (int __fd, const void *__buf, size_t __n);
libc_hidden_proto (__libc_write)
libc_hidden_proto (write)
```

In the Linux kernel side.


### Understand `glibc` linking in cross-compile environemnt.
Let's hack the host system, Debian 11, `glibc` information for amd64.
```shell
$ file /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6
/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6: ELF 64-bit LSB shared object, x86-64, version 1 (GNU/Linux), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib64/ld-linux-x86-64.so.2, BuildID[sha1]=79005c16293efa45b441fed45f4f29b138557e9e, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, stripped 
# or
$ /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6

```

Now, it's time to move to ARM side.
First, let's find a `sysroot` path.
```shell
$ arm-none-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -print-sysroot
/opt/arm-gnu-toolchain-14.2.rel1-linux-gnueabihf/bin/../arm-none-linux-gnueabihf/libc
```

View `glibc` information for ARM
```shell
$ file /opt/arm-gnu-toolchain-14.2.rel1-linux-gnueabihf/arm-none-linux-gnueabihf/libc/lib/libc.so.6 
/opt/arm-gnu-toolchain-14.2.rel1-linux-gnueabihf/arm-none-linux-gnueabihf/libc/lib/libc.so.6: ELF 32-bit LSB shared object, ARM, EABI5 version 1 (SYSV), dynamically linked, interpreter /lib/ld-linux-armhf.so.3, for GNU/Linux 3.2.0, with debug_info, not stripped
```

What's the version in this case?
```shell
$ strings /opt/arm-gnu-toolchain-14.2.rel1-linux-gnueabihf/bin/../arm-none-linux-gnueabihf/libc/lib/libc.so.6 | grep 'release version'
GNU C Library (Arm GNU Toolchain 14.2.Rel1 (Build arm-14.52)) stable release version 2.40. 
```
We can use `strings` command also in amd64 glibc
```shell
$ strings /lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6 | grep 'release version'
GNU C Library (Debian GLIBC 2.36-9+deb12u10) stable release version 2.36.
```


Compile the simple C source code for each environment: ARM and amd64.  
Then, hack the binaries.  
**main.c**
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main(void) {
  printf("hello world!\n");
  return 0;
}
```

It's very well-known C program. I'm going to make two versions of this.
```shell
# for host system(amd64)
$ gcc -o amd64 main.c
# for arm
$ arm-none-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -o arm main.c
```

Contents in the current directory.
```shell
$ ls
amd64  arm  main.c
```

View linked libraries for each.
```shell
$ objdump -p amd64 | grep NEEDED
  NEEDED               libc.so.6
$ objdump -p arm | grep NEEDED
  NEEDED               libc.so.6
```
As I expected, both of those executable object files is linking `libc.so`, which is the `glibc` library.


## Problems & Solutions


## Memo
- About `unistd.h` header file.
  - the C standard libray for Unix-like systems.
  - in `glibc`

- Have to compile `strace` for the ARM architecture to run it QEMU ARM.
- Which C standard library used while cross compiling by arm-toolchain?
  - How know that?
    - Compile both of for `x64` and `arm`, then use `readelf` or `objdump`

- `arm-none-linux-gnueabihf-gcc -print-sysroot -print-sysroot` returns the sysroot path but not `gcc -print-sysroot`.
  - The reason why,
    - `arm-none-linux-gnueabihf-gcc` is a **cross-compiler**, so it is configured explicitly with a sysroot.
    - Why is `sysroot`? What's role of this?
      - Think about the compilation process.
      - The compiler needs to know where to find the target's headers and libraries.
        - `sysroot` mimic the root file system of the target system.
