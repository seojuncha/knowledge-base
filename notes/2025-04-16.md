## Question
- How Linux kernel manages process status?

## today's new
### Add signal handlers
I've used `sigaction` now.
```shell
$ man 2 sigaction
```

### Four types of status changes for a child process
1. terminated
2. stopped
3. continued
4. traced
All of above can be detected in a parent process via `waitpid()` system call.  


### today's system calls
- `pause`
- `waitpid`
- `fork`
- `sigaction`

## Problems & Solutions
### VSCode Intellisence is not working for `WCONTINUED`, `siginfo_t`, and `struct sigaction`

**Read Linux manual page very carefully!!** 
In order to enable feature test macro, a macro features should be defined.
```c
#define _GNU_SOURCE
#include <stdio.h>
// something...
```
