## Goal
- How does Cortex-A7 ARM processor; `armv7-a` architecture deal with a system call?

## New
**Supervisor call(SVC, previously SWI)**
- `svc` is just one of the CPU instructions. It doesn't mention "How system calls are operated".

**System Call table in Linux kernel**
```shell
$ cd linux
$ find . -name "syscall.tbl"
./arch/sparc/kernel/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./arch/s390/kernel/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./arch/powerpc/kernel/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./arch/xtensa/kernel/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./arch/arm/tools/syscall.tbl
./arch/m68k/kernel/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./arch/parisc/kernel/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./arch/microblaze/kernel/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./arch/sh/kernel/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./arch/alpha/kernel/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./scripts/syscall.tbl
./tools/scripts/syscall.tbl
./tools/perf/arch/sparc/entry/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./tools/perf/arch/s390/entry/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./tools/perf/arch/powerpc/entry/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./tools/perf/arch/xtensa/entry/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./tools/perf/arch/arm/entry/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./tools/perf/arch/parisc/entry/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./tools/perf/arch/sh/entry/syscalls/syscall.tbl
./tools/perf/arch/alpha/entry/syscalls/syscall.tbl
```

## Problems & Solutions
`struct ptrace_syscall_info` isn't defined in glibc library for ARM. So I couldn't read the syscall information via `ptrace(PTRACE_GET_SYSCALL_INFO, ...)`.

So, use `PTRACE_GETREGS` to read a syscall number stored in `r7` register.  
What a data structure can be used?: 
- go to <sys/user.h> (mentioned in ptrace(2) man page)

There is `struct user_regs` structure!


## Todo
- How can I know syscall enter-stop in ARM?

## Memo
- In (**ARM Architecture Reference Manual ARMv7-A and ARMv7-R edition**)[https://developer.arm.com/documentation/ddi0406/latest/]
- System calls are an operating system concept, not a CPU architecture concept.
- The SVC instruction causes a Supervisor Call exception. This provides a mechanism for
unprivileged software to make a call to the operating system, or other system component that
is accessible only at PL1.
- Software can use this instruction as a call to an operating system to provide a service.
- `ptrace` is just a Linux system call.
- Instruction-Level (like `SVC`) → Architecture-specific.
- System Call-Level (like `ptrace`, `strace`) → Architecture-independent.
