# Compiler 
**Goal**
- Remove unused front-end code, like C++, ObjC to make it simplify
- Create an AST for C code.
  - To compare my compiler
- Print debug messages while compiling phases
- Make `clang` to be specify for only C language for beginners.

**TODO**
- More optimized compiling `clang`

## Building clang on MacOS and Linux(Debian)
### How to build
- git clone "llvm-project"
- Then, build it by using `CMake` & `Make`

```bash
$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="ARM;X86" -G "Unix Makefiles" ../llvm
$ make -j $(nproc)  # for linux
$ make -j $(sysctl -n hw.ncpu)   # for MacOS
```

### Common Errors that I have faced
```
collect2: fatal error: ld terminated with signal 9 [Killed]
```
the linker (ld) was killed by the system, most likely due to `Out of Memory`

My Solution
- Use `Ninja` to more optimize building
- Use less cores while building
- Specify build targets.

First try to use `Ninja`
```
$ sudo apt install ninja-build

$ cmake -G Ninja -DLLVM_ENABLE_PROJECTS=clang -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebInfo ../llvm
$ ninja -j 8
```
**How to specify back-end codegen targets?**
- Define `LVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD` options with `cmake`.

> LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD:STRING
> 
> Semicolon-separated list of targets to build, or all for building all targets. Case-sensitive. Defaults to all. Example: -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD="X86;PowerPC". The full list, as of March 2023, is: AArch64;AMDGPU;ARM;AVR;BPF;Hexagon;Lanai;LoongArch;Mips;MSP430;NVPTX;PowerPC;RISCV;Sparc;SystemZ;VE;WebAssembly;X86;XCore
>
> You can also specify host or Native to automatically detect and include the target corresponding to the host machineâ€™s architecture, or use all to include all available targets. For example, on an x86_64 machine, specifying -DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=host will include the X86 target.

**on MacOS vs on Linux**

My Macbook has 16G memory and Debian linux has 32G memory. However, when I use `make` with 16 cores, the compilation, more precisly the linking, was not failed on MacOS but not on Linux. What's the reason?? Was it optimized for clang more than gcc?

### Confirmation
output path would be `llvm/build/bin`(Add to `PATH` if you want)

```bash
$ ls bin | grep "clang"
```
---
Example C file: `main.c`
```c
#include <stdio.h>
int main() {
  printf("hello \n");
  return 0;
}
```
Run below command in the build directory
- for MacOS
```bash
$ bin/clang -isysroot $(xcrun --show-sdk-path) main.c 
```
- for Linux
```bash
```

**Warning on MacOS**

Note that, if you run `bin/clang` alone, the compilation will be failed because `clang` built by me doesn't know standard library paths. So we let `clang` know the paths.
```bash
$ xcrun --show-sdk-path
/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk
```

> For debug the include paths accepted by `clang`
>
> $ clang -v main.c

-----
Example C++ file: `main.cc`
```c++
#include <iostream>
int main() {
  std::cout << "hello world" << std::endl;
  return 0;
}
```

Run below command in the build directory
- for MacOS
```bash
$ clang++ -isysroot $(xcrun --show-sdk-path) main.cc
```
Do not compile `main.cc` that is C++ code via `clang` but `clang++`.

- for Linux
```bash

```

## Cleaning jobs
- keep Actions, Lexer, Parser for only C.
  - Remove C++
  - Remove Object C
  - Remove code completion
  - Remove CIR(Not needed now, use ordinary IR in CodeGen)
- Not support precompiling
- Only works for front-end parts now.
- Check back-end module dependencies.
- Need ASTMater for AST debugging


## Prepare Common Lisp implementation
The lexer and the parser that are similar with `clang`

Example expression: `1+2`

- The lookahead method to manage tokens
  - next-token()
    - Return the next token(lookahead token)
  - current-token()
    - Return the current token?!
  - consume()
    - No return
    - just consume a token from the token stream.
      - should I implement the token stream?
  - cur-ptr
    - first, points to the token `1` that is a numeric constant 
- Implement a few functions
  - top-down parsing mechanism
  - parse-expression(expr)
  - parse-rhs-of-binary-expression(lhs)
- Define a simple AST for a binary expression
